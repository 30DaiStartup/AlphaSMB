## Home Page (index.html)

### Hero

- **Eyebrow:** AI TRANSFORMATION FOR SMBS (uppercase, tracked)
- **Headline:** Your competitors aren't waiting. Neither should you.
- **Subheadline:** I help SMB leadership teams build AI-capable organizations — not just AI-equipped employees — so they can compete with anyone regardless of budget or headcount.
- **CTA:** Book a Strategy Call — $500
- **Credential bar:** Fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC, a human intelligence agency serving the Fortune 1000 · Epic Systems · 20+ years across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing & software

### Problem Section

- **Headline:** The gap isn't about tools. It's about your organization.
- **Block 1 lead:** Everyone has the same tools. Not everyone has the same results.
- **Block 1 body:** Every AI tool on the market is available to your competitors for the same price you'd pay. ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot — none of them are a competitive advantage anymore. The advantage is whether your organization knows how to think with them, not just use them. That's an organizational capability, not a software purchase.
- **Block 2 lead:** Transformation doesn't fail because of technology. It fails because of people.
- **Block 2 body:** You can hand every employee a premium AI subscription tomorrow. In 30 days, 80% of them will have stopped using it. Not because the tools don't work — because nobody shifted their mindset, showed them what's possible, or gave them permission to experiment. Tools without culture change is just an expensive experiment.
- **Block 3 lead:** You can't afford to figure this out by trial and error.
- **Block 3 body:** Every month your organization spends fumbling with AI adoption is a month your competitors are pulling ahead. The gap compounds. And unlike most business challenges, this one has an expiration date — the window to establish an AI-capable culture is open now and closing fast.

### What You Get

- **Headline:** Two ways to work with AlphaSMB
- **Card 1 — Strategy Call:** One-Hour AI Strategy Call / $500 / deliverable list / Book Your Call →
- **Card 2 — Transformation:** Full Transformation Engagement / Contact for pricing / Limited to two clients at a time / Let's Talk →

### Social Proof

- **Headline:** What leaders are saying
- **Quote:** "I currently run AI strategy for Aurora WDC, a human intelligence agency serving the Fortune 1000. I've built and operated businesses across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, and software. I don't just know AI — I know the operations, the politics, and the resistance that come with changing how an organization works."
- **Attribution:** — Zach Henderson, Founder of AlphaSMB

### Methodology

- **Headline:** How it works
- **Step 1:** Mindset first. / We start with leadership. If the people at the top don't think differently about AI, nothing changes below them.
- **Step 2:** Find your champion. / We identify the person your organization already listens to and turn them into your AI transformation catalyst.
- **Step 3:** Activate the high-agency people. / Your best people are waiting for permission to move. We surface who they are and give them the tools and methods to lead from within.
- **Step 4:** Measure what matters. / Weekly scoring against industry benchmarks so you always know where you stand — and so does your leadership team.

### Bottom CTA

- **Headline:** Be the alpha. (gradient text white→ember)
- **Subtext:** One hour. One conversation. A plan you can start executing tomorrow.
