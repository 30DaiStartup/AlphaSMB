## Home Page (index.html)

### Hero

- **Eyebrow:** AI TRANSFORMATION FOR SMBS (uppercase, tracked)
- **Headline:** Your competitors aren't waiting. Neither should you.
- **Subheadline:** I help SMB leadership teams build AI-capable organizations — not just AI-equipped employees — so they can compete with anyone regardless of budget or headcount.
- **CTA:** Book a Strategy Call — $500
- **Credential bar:** Fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC, a human intelligence agency serving the Fortune 1000 · Epic Systems · 20+ years across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing & software

### Problem Section

- **Headline:** The gap isn't about tools. It's about your organization.
- **Block 1 lead:** Everyone has the same tools. Not everyone has the same results.
- **Block 1 body:** Every AI tool on the market is available to your competitors for the same price you'd pay. ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot — none of them are a competitive advantage anymore. The real advantage is organizational capability — and capability changes everything. Where you can compete, how you can win, and what your business is capable of becoming. That's not a tool decision. It's a strategy decision.
- **Block 2 lead:** Transformation doesn't fail because of technology. It fails because of people.
- **Block 2 body:** You can hand every employee a premium AI subscription tomorrow. In 30 days, 80% of them will have stopped using it. Not because the tools don't work — because nobody shifted their mindset, showed them what's possible, or gave them permission to experiment. Tools without culture change is just an expensive experiment.
- **Block 3 lead:** You can't afford to figure this out by trial and error.
- **Block 3 body:** Every month your organization spends fumbling with AI adoption is a month your competitors are pulling ahead. The gap compounds. And unlike most business challenges, this one has an expiration date — the window to establish an AI-capable culture is open now and closing fast.

### Strategy Section (Manifesto)

- **Headline:** AI isn't a tool decision. It's a strategy decision.
- **Para 1:** Every AI tool on the market is available to your competitors for the same price you'd pay. ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot — none of them are a competitive advantage anymore.
- **Para 2:** The real advantage is organizational capability. And capability changes everything — where you can compete, how you can win, and what your business is capable of becoming.
- **Para 3:** But here's what most leaders get wrong: you can't see those possibilities from a slide deck. You can't strategy-deck your way into a new future. You have to take the first steps with the capability before the strategic picture comes into focus.
- **Para 4:** That's why transformation starts with a single conversation — not a six-month planning cycle.
- **Design:** Dark bg with slate borders, 140px padding desktop, no CTA — pure positioning

### What You Get

- **Headline:** Two ways to work with AlphaSMB
- **Card 1 — Strategy Call:** One-Hour AI Strategy Call / $500 / deliverable list / Book Your Call →
- **Card 2 — Transformation:** Full Transformation Engagement / Contact for pricing / Limited to two clients at a time / Let's Talk →

### Social Proof

- **Headline:** What leaders are saying
- **Quote:** "I currently run AI strategy for Aurora WDC, a human intelligence agency serving the Fortune 1000. I've built and operated businesses across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, and software. I don't just know AI — I know the operations, the politics, and the resistance that come with changing how an organization works."
- **Attribution:** — Zach Henderson, Founder of AlphaSMB

### Methodology

- **Headline:** How it works
- **Step 1:** Mindset first. / We start with leadership. If the people at the top don't think differently about AI, nothing changes below them.
- **Step 2:** Find your champion. / We identify the person your organization already listens to and turn them into your AI transformation catalyst.
- **Step 3:** Activate the high-agency people. / Your best people are waiting for permission to move. We surface who they are and give them the tools and methods to lead from within.
- **Step 4:** Measure what matters. / Weekly scoring against industry benchmarks so you always know where you stand — and so does your leadership team.

### Bottom CTA

- **Headline:** Be the alpha. (gradient text white→ember)
- **Subtext:** One hour. One conversation. A plan you can start executing tomorrow.
- **CTA:** Book a Strategy Call — $500

## Strategy Call Page (services/strategy-call.html)

### Hero
- **Headline:** One-Hour AI Strategy Call
- **Price:** $500
- **Description:** A focused, high-intensity session for SMB leaders who know they need to move on AI but want a clear plan before they do.
- **CTA:** Book Your Call — $500
- **Trust line:** Fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC, serving the Fortune 1000 · Epic Systems · 20+ years across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing & software

### Time Blocks
- 15 min — Deep Dive (current state, operations, tools, team dynamics, competitive landscape)
- 15 min — Assessment (scoring across mindset, skillset, toolset)
- 20 min — Roadmap (transformation plan, quick wins, phased priorities)
- 10 min — Next Steps (questions, whether deeper engagement makes sense)

### Deliverables
Checklist: AI Readiness Assessment, benchmarking, roadmap, scorecard, 48-hour action plan, branded PDF

### Strategy Bridge (between deliverables summary and checklist)
- **Copy:** This isn't just an AI readiness check. We map how AI capability changes your competitive options — where you can play that you couldn't before, and how you can win in ways that weren't available to you last year. Most leaders are surprised by what becomes possible once the capability is real.
- **Style:** Italic, ember left-border, 17px

### Why a Strategy Call First (between "Is this right for you?" and FAQ)
- **Headline:** Why a strategy call — not a pilot program
- **Body:** Most companies start their AI journey with a pilot. Buy some licenses. Pick a use case. See what happens. / That's backwards. / AI is a capability that changes your entire competitive position — where you can compete, how you can win, what your business can become. You wouldn't launch a new market strategy without understanding the capability first. AI is no different. / The strategy call exists because you need to understand what's possible before you can plan what's next. Not the other way around.
- **Emphasis line:** One hour. Six deliverables. A strategic foundation — not just a tool recommendation.
- **CTA:** Book a Strategy Call — $500 → /book

### Who For / Not For
- For: SMB leaders (20-500 employees), tried AI but adoption didn't stick, competitive pressure, healthcare/real estate/manufacturing/professional services
- Not for: "just implement ChatGPT," no leadership commitment, want vendor recommendation not strategy

### FAQ
1. What if I need more than one hour? → Monthly follow-up + anchor engagement
2. Is this a sales pitch? → No, deliverable stands alone
3. What industries? → Cross-industry, deep in healthcare/real estate/manufacturing/software
4. Can I expense this? → Yes, invoice provided
5. Why a strategy call instead of a pilot program? → AI is a capability that changes your entire competitive position. You need to understand what's possible before you can plan what's next. The strategy call gives you a strategic foundation — not just a tool recommendation.
