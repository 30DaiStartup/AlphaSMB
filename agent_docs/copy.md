# AlphaSMB — Page Copy Reference

All copy for the coming-soon page. Use exactly as written.

## Hero (Section A)

- **Tagline:** AI transformation for the businesses that refuse to be left behind.
- **Subtext:** We help SMB leadership teams build AI-capable organizations — not just AI-equipped employees.
- **CTA Button:** Get Early Access
- **Input Placeholder:** your@email.com
- **Trust Line:** Join founders and operators already on the list.
- **Validation Error:** Please enter a valid email address.

## Post-Submit (Section A-alt)

- **Headline:** You're on the list.
- **Subtext:** We'll be in touch when we're ready. In the meantime — your competitors aren't waiting either.
- Checkmark "✓" in ember, scales in with bounce (cubic-bezier 0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)

## Problem (Section B)

- **Headline:** Your competitors just got faster. Did you?

**Paragraphs** (emphasize bolded phrases with `--alpha-white` + weight 600):

1. Somewhere right now, a company your size is using AI to **do in a weekend what takes your team a month**. They didn't hire more people. They didn't raise more money. They just moved first.
2. The gap isn't about tools — every tool is available to everyone. **The gap is organizational.** It's whether your people know how to think with AI, not just use it.
3. That's the difference between **AI-equipped and AI-capable**. And it's the difference between leading your market and scrambling to catch up.

## What's Coming (Section C)

- **Headline:** What AlphaSMB delivers

| Label | Body |
|-------|------|
| A proven playbook, not a pitch deck. | A phased transformation methodology built from real engagements — not theory. |
| Your highest-agency people, identified. | We surface who in your organization is ready to lead the change — before you have to guess. |
| Measurable progress, weekly. | A proprietary rubric benchmarks your adoption against peers so you always know where you stand. |

Each item: 3-4px left border in ember, 20px left padding. Stagger fade-in by 150ms each.

## Bottom CTA (Section D)

- **Headline:** Be the alpha.
  - CSS gradient text: white → ember, ~135deg angle
  - Fallback: just white
- Same email CTA component as hero — shared state
- **Footer:** © 2026 AlphaSMB. All rights reserved.
