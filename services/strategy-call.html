        <p class="strategy-bridge reveal" style="margin: 32px 0;">This isn't just an AI readiness check. I map how AI capability changes your competitive options &mdash; where you can play that you couldn't before, and how you can win in ways that weren't available to you last year. Most leaders walk in thinking about tools. They walk out thinking about strategy.</p>

        <div class="philosophy-text reveal">
          <p>Most companies start their AI journey with a pilot. Buy some licenses. Pick a use case. See what happens.</p>
          <p>That's backwards.</p>
          <p>AI is a capability &mdash; and new capabilities change what your business can do. New markets open. Competitive advantages shift. Strategies that weren't viable last year become obvious next moves. You wouldn't commit to a new market without understanding the landscape first. AI is no different.</p>
          <p>The strategy call exists because you need to understand what's possible before you can plan what's next. Not the other way around.</p>
