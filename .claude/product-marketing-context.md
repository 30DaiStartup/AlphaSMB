# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-19*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** AI transformation consultancy that builds AI-capable organizations, not just AI-equipped employees.
**What it does:** AlphaSMB helps SMB leadership teams (20-500 employees) adopt AI at the organizational level through a proven methodology that starts with mindset shifts at the leadership level, identifies internal champions, activates high-agency employees, and measures progress against industry benchmarks. The primary service is a $500 one-hour strategy call that delivers an AI readiness assessment, transformation roadmap, and 48-hour action plan.
**Product category:** AI consulting / AI transformation consulting / organizational change management
**Product type:** Professional service (consulting)
**Business model:** Two tiers — (1) One-hour AI strategy call at $500 (primary revenue and lead-gen engine, up to 10/week), (2) Full transformation engagement at custom pricing (~5 hrs/week for up to 3 months, limited to 2 clients at a time). Optional monthly follow-up calls at $500/month for strategy call clients.

## Target Audience
**Target companies:** SMBs with 20-500 employees across healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, professional services, and software. Companies that know they need to move on AI but haven't figured out how to make it stick organizationally.
**Decision-makers:** Founders, CEOs, COOs, and other C-suite/VP-level leaders at SMBs. People who control budget and can authorize organizational change.
**Primary use case:** Building organizational AI capability — not tool selection, not individual training, but transforming how the entire organization thinks about and works with AI.
**Jobs to be done:**
- "Help me figure out where to start with AI for my organization"
- "We bought AI tools but nobody's actually using them — fix that"
- "Our competitors are pulling ahead with AI and I need a plan to catch up"
**Use cases:**
- SMB leader who knows AI matters but is overwhelmed by options and doesn't know where to start
- Organization that rolled out ChatGPT/Copilot subscriptions but saw 80% drop-off in 30 days
- Company facing competitive pressure from AI-native competitors and needs to move fast
- Leadership team preparing for board/investor conversations about AI strategy

## Personas
| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| CEO/Founder (Decision Maker + Financial Buyer) | Competitive position, ROI, not wasting money on another failed initiative | Doesn't know where to start, worried about picking the wrong approach, has seen other tech initiatives fail | A clear plan you can start executing this week, built by someone who's done this at the Fortune 1000 level |
| COO/VP Ops (Champion) | Operational efficiency, team adoption, practical implementation | Knows AI could help but can't get the organization to change, tools sit unused | A transformation methodology that actually gets people to change behavior, not just another tool rollout |
| IT/Tech Lead (Technical Influencer) | Tool selection, integration, security, practical concerns | Gets asked to "implement AI" without organizational support or clear direction | A strategic framework that gives technical work organizational backing and clear priorities |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** SMBs are falling behind on AI not because they lack access to tools (everyone has the same tools at the same price) but because they lack the organizational capability to adopt and sustain AI usage. It's a people and culture problem, not a technology problem.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Generic AI consultants sell tool implementations without addressing culture change — tools without culture change is an expensive experiment
- Big consulting firms (McKinsey, Deloitte) price out SMBs entirely
- Online courses and certifications train individuals but don't transform organizations
- Hiring an AI person internally doesn't solve the organizational adoption problem
- "Just implement ChatGPT" vendors treat AI as a software purchase, not a capability
**What it costs them:** Every month spent fumbling with AI adoption is a month competitors pull ahead. The gap compounds. Failed AI tool rollouts waste budget and create organizational cynicism ("we tried AI, it didn't work"). The window to establish an AI-capable culture is closing fast.
**Emotional tension:** Fear of being left behind. Frustration that they've spent money on AI tools with nothing to show for it. Doubt about whether they're big enough or sophisticated enough to "do AI." Overwhelm at the pace of change and the number of options.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Other AI transformation consultants / fractional AI leaders — most are either (a) too enterprise-focused and expensive, or (b) tool-focused implementers who don't address organizational change. AlphaSMB uniquely combines Fortune 1000 methodology with SMB accessibility and pricing.
**Secondary:** AI tool vendors (Microsoft Copilot rollouts, ChatGPT Team plans) — they sell subscriptions and basic training but don't address the mindset, culture, and organizational capability gaps that determine whether tools actually get used.
**Indirect:** Doing nothing / figuring it out internally — the default for most SMBs. Fails because AI transformation requires expertise in organizational change management that most SMBs don't have in-house. Trial and error is too slow when the competitive window is closing.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- Fortune 1000 methodology (same playbook run at Aurora WDC) translated for SMB budgets and team sizes
- Organizational transformation focus, not tool implementation — "I build the culture that actually uses the tools"
- Anti-consultant positioning — an operator who's been in the fire, not a vendor with a slide deck
- Proven framework: mindset first → find the champion → activate high-agency people → measure against benchmarks
- Skin in the game: limited to 2 anchor clients at a time (real scarcity, not artificial)
**How we do it differently:** Start with leadership mindset, not technology. Identify the internal champion the organization already listens to. Activate high-agency employees to lead from within. Measure weekly against industry benchmarks.
**Why that's better:** Organizations that change their culture sustain AI adoption. Organizations that just buy tools see 80% drop-off in 30 days. The methodology outlasts the engagement.
**Why customers choose us:** Credibility (current Fortune 1000 AI leadership role), practical experience (20+ years across multiple industries as an operator, not a consultant), accessible pricing ($500 entry point vs. $50K+ for traditional consulting), and a deliverable that stands on its own (you can execute the plan independently).

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "$500 for an hour is expensive" | You walk away with an AI readiness assessment, benchmarking, a three-phase roadmap, an execution scorecard, and a 48-hour action plan — a branded PDF you can share with your leadership team. Many clients expense it under professional development or strategic consulting. |
| "Is this just a sales pitch for a bigger engagement?" | No. The deliverable is valuable on its own — you'll leave with a plan you can execute independently. If a deeper engagement makes sense, I'll tell you. If it doesn't, I'll tell you that too. I'd rather give you an honest hour than a dishonest pitch. |
| "We're too small for AI transformation" | If you have 20+ employees and knowledge workers, you're the perfect size. SMBs can actually move faster than enterprises because you have less bureaucracy and shorter decision chains. The methodology is designed for your scale. |

**Anti-persona:** Companies looking for someone to "just implement ChatGPT." Organizations where leadership isn't committed to change. Teams that want a vendor recommendation, not a transformation strategy. Solopreneurs or very small teams (under 20 employees) where "organizational transformation" doesn't apply.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Wasted money on AI tool subscriptions nobody uses. Watching competitors adopt AI faster. Board/investor pressure to have an AI strategy. Fear of irrelevance. Failed internal attempts at AI adoption.
**Pull:** A clear, actionable plan from someone who's done this at the Fortune 1000 level. Low-risk entry point ($500 strategy call, not a $50K engagement). Proven methodology with specific framework and deliverables. Credibility of current Fortune 1000 AI leadership role.
**Habit:** "We'll figure it out ourselves eventually." Comfort with current tools and processes. Reluctance to admit they need outside help. Inertia of existing workflows.
**Anxiety:** "What if this is just another consultant who takes our money and leaves us with a generic deck?" "What if our team resists?" "What if we're too far behind to catch up?" "Is $500 worth it for just one hour?"

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Direct, confident, conversational. Warm but no-nonsense. Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-client.
**Style:** First person ("I" not "we"). Specific over generic. Name the pain before the solution. Let credentials speak through context, not claims. Short sentences mixed with longer explanations. No corporate jargon, no AI hype language.
**Personality:** Operator who's been in the fire. Anti-consultant. Honest (will tell you if a deeper engagement doesn't make sense). Experienced across industries. Accessible but not cheap. Confident without arrogance.
