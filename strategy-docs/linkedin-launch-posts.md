## Post Format Guidelines

### Hook Structure

The first 1-3 lines of every LinkedIn post are everything. They appear above the "see more" fold. Every post must open with a hook that creates enough tension, curiosity, or recognition to earn the click.

**Hook formulas that work for this brand:**

- **Contrarian statement:** "Most AI consultants sell you tools. That's the problem."
- **Pattern interrupt:** "I've watched 6-figure AI rollouts fail in 30 days. Every time, the reason is the same."
- **Direct confession:** "I built something. Took me 20 years to be ready."
- **Specific number + surprise:** "80% of employees stop using AI tools within 30 days. The tools aren't the problem."
- **Audience callout:** "If you're an SMB leader who bought ChatGPT licenses and nobody's using them — read this."

### Ideal Length

- **Sweet spot:** 150-300 words (roughly 800-1,500 characters)
- LinkedIn rewards posts that keep people on-platform. Long enough to deliver value, short enough to finish.
- Use line breaks aggressively. One thought per paragraph. Many paragraphs should be a single sentence.
- Never write a wall of text.

### Paragraph Structure

- 1-2 sentences per paragraph, max.
- White space is your friend. Every line break earns another second of attention.
- Use a dash (--) instead of semicolons. Keep it conversational.

### CTA Placement

- **Primary CTA** belongs at the very end of the post, after you've earned it.
- Never lead with a CTA. Build the case first.
- Keep the CTA soft in most posts — "Link in comments" or "DM me" works better than "BUY NOW."
- For direct CTA posts (Day 5 style), be explicit: "Here's the link. Book it."
- Always put the URL in the **first comment**, not in the post body. LinkedIn suppresses reach on posts with external links in the body.

### Hashtag Strategy

- **3-5 hashtags per post**, placed at the very bottom after a line break.
- Mix broad and niche:
  - Broad (1-2): `#AI` `#Leadership` `#SmallBusiness`
  - Mid-tier (1-2): `#AIStrategy` `#AITransformation` `#FractionalLeadership`
  - Niche (1): `#AIforSMBs` `#OrganizationalChange`
- Rotate hashtags across posts. Don't use the same set every time.
- Never use more than 5. It looks desperate.

### Voice Reminders

- First person. Always "I" — never "we" or "AlphaSMB."
- Specific over generic. Name a real scenario, not a vague principle.
- Short sentences mixed with longer ones. Rhythm matters.
- No corporate jargon. No "leverage," "synergy," "unlock value," "harness the power of AI."
- Anti-consultant tone. You're an operator, not a vendor.

## Launch Week Plan

### Day 1 — Announcement Post ("I built something")

**Goal:** Signal to your network that something new exists. Generate curiosity. Earn congratulations engagement (LinkedIn's algorithm rewards comments).

```
I built something.

It took 20 years of operating businesses — healthcare IT, real estate, manufacturing, software — to be ready to build this.

For the past year, I've been running AI strategy at the Fortune 1000 level as the fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC. What I kept seeing was this:

The methodology works. The framework is proven. But it's only available to companies with six-figure consulting budgets.

Meanwhile, the businesses that need it most — the 20 to 500 employee companies where one good decision can change everything — are stuck figuring it out alone. Buying tools nobody uses. Watching competitors pull ahead. Wondering if they're too small to "do AI."

They're not too small. They're underserved.

So I built AlphaSMB.

It's an AI transformation consultancy designed specifically for SMB leadership teams. Not a SaaS platform. Not a course. Not a vendor who shows up with a slide deck and leaves you with a generic playbook.

It's the same methodology I run at the Fortune 1000 level — translated for the budgets, team sizes, and decision speed of smaller businesses.

The site is live. The calendar is open.

More details in the comments.

#AITransformation #SmallBusiness #AI #Leadership #FractionalLeadership
```

**First comment:** "Here's the site: alphasmb.com — The core offering is a one-hour AI strategy call ($500) where you walk away with an AI readiness assessment, transformation roadmap, and a 48-hour action plan. Built for SMB leaders who know they need to move on AI but want a clear plan before they do."

---

### Day 2 — Problem-Awareness Post (Why AI Adoption Fails)

**Goal:** Establish expertise by naming the real problem. Position the insight, not the product. Create "this is exactly what's happening to us" recognition in the target audience.

```
Every AI tool on the market is available to your competitors for the same price you'd pay.

ChatGPT. Claude. Copilot. Gemini.

Same tools. Same price. Same access.

So why are some organizations 10x more productive with them?

It's not the tools. It's the organization behind them.

I've watched this pattern play out dozens of times now: A leadership team buys premium AI subscriptions for everyone. There's a burst of excitement. Maybe a few internal champions start doing interesting things.

Then 30 days later, 80% of the team has stopped using them.

Not because the tools don't work. Because nobody shifted the mindset. Nobody showed people what was actually possible for their specific role. Nobody gave them permission to experiment.

Tools without culture change is just an expensive experiment.

The companies winning with AI didn't start with better technology. They started with a leadership team willing to change how the organization thinks — not just what it uses.

That's the gap. And it's widening every month.

#AI #AIStrategy #Leadership #OrganizationalChange #SmallBusiness
```

**First comment:** "This is the core problem I built AlphaSMB to solve. Not tool selection — organizational transformation. If this sounds familiar, I wrote more about the methodology here: alphasmb.com/about"

---

### Day 3 — Credibility / Story Post (Career Journey)

**Goal:** Build trust through narrative. Let credentials emerge through story, not claims. Create connection by showing the path that led here.

```
People ask me how I ended up doing AI transformation consulting for small businesses.

The honest answer is that I took the long way.

I started in industrial engineering. Moved into healthcare IT. Spent years at Epic Systems, where I learned what it looks like when technology meets organizational resistance at scale.

Then I spent 20+ years in real estate investing — residential, commercial, complex deal structures. Built and operated product companies. Did management consulting across manufacturing, software, healthcare, and professional services.

None of that was a straight line. But all of it taught me the same lesson:

Technology doesn't transform organizations. People do.

The best tool in the world fails if the culture won't adopt it. The worst process in the world survives if nobody has permission to change it.

When AI hit an inflection point, I realized everything I'd spent two decades learning was suddenly the thing that mattered most — how organizations actually change. Not the theory. The real, messy, political, human reality of it.

Now I run AI strategy at the Fortune 1000 level as the fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC. And I started AlphaSMB to bring that same methodology to the businesses that can't afford McKinsey but shouldn't have to figure this out alone.

That's the whole story. No TED talk. Just 20 years of being in the fire.

**First comment:** "If you're curious about the methodology behind how I approach AI transformation, here's the full breakdown: alphasmb.com/services/strategy-call"

---

### Day 4 — Value Post (What You Get from a Strategy Call)

**Goal:** Make the offer tangible. Answer "what do I actually get?" before they have to ask. Remove ambiguity — price, time, deliverables, all of it.

```
Here's exactly what happens on an AlphaSMB strategy call.

No mystery. No "let's discuss pricing later." The whole thing is transparent.

It's one hour. It costs $500. Here's the breakdown:

First 15 minutes — I go deep on your current state. Your operations, your tools, your team dynamics, your competitive landscape. I ask hard questions. You give honest answers.

Next 15 minutes — I score your organization across three dimensions: mindset, skillset, and toolset. This is the AI Readiness Assessment. Most leaders have never seen their organization evaluated this way. It changes how you think about the problem.

Next 20 minutes — We build your transformation roadmap together. Quick wins you can execute this week. Phased priorities for the next 90 days. Specific, practical, built for your business — not a generic framework.

Final 10 minutes — Questions, next steps, and an honest conversation about whether a deeper engagement makes sense. If it doesn't, I'll tell you. I'd rather give you a useful hour than a dishonest pitch.

After the call, you get a branded PDF with everything: the assessment, benchmarking against your industry, the roadmap, an execution scorecard, and a 48-hour action plan.

You can take that document and execute it independently. That's the point.

$500. One hour. A plan you can start on tomorrow.

#AIStrategy #AI #SmallBusiness #Leadership #AIforSMBs
```

**First comment:** "Book directly here — no sales funnel, no discovery call, no 47-step sequence. Just pick a time: alphasmb.com/book"

---

### Day 5 — Direct CTA Post (Book a Call)

**Goal:** Convert. This is the ask. Be direct. Anyone who's been following the week already knows what you do and why. Now close the loop.

```
I'm going to be direct.

If you run a business with 20 to 500 employees and you know AI should be a bigger part of how your organization operates — but you don't have a plan — I can help.

I'm not going to sell you software. I'm not going to give you a generic playbook. I'm not going to show up with a slide deck full of buzzwords and leave you to figure it out.

Here's what I will do:

Spend one hour with you. Assess where your organization actually stands on AI readiness. Build a transformation roadmap specific to your business. Give you a 48-hour action plan so you're not wondering what to do next.

The call is $500. You get a branded deliverable you can share with your leadership team. You can execute the plan independently — no ongoing commitment required.

I'm taking 10 calls per week, max. Not because of artificial scarcity — because I do this work personally and I refuse to half-ass it.

If this is for you, book it. Link is in the comments.

If it's not for you but you know someone who needs this, send it their way. That's how most of my best conversations start.

**First comment:** "Here's the link: alphasmb.com/book — Pick a time, pay at booking, show up ready to work. That's it."

## Evergreen Post Templates

These are reusable formats for ongoing posting after launch week. Fill in the bracketed sections with fresh content each time.

---

### Template 1 — "The Real Reason [X] Fails"

**Use for:** Positioning expertise, naming uncomfortable truths, building authority.

**Frequency:** Once every 1-2 weeks.

```
The real reason [specific AI initiative] fails at most companies has nothing to do with [the thing everyone blames].

It's [the actual root cause].

[2-3 short paragraphs explaining the root cause with a specific example or pattern you've seen. Be concrete — name the scenario, the timeline, the outcome. No abstractions.]

[1 paragraph reframing the problem in a way that points toward organizational change, not technology.]

The fix isn't [common but wrong solution]. It's [the actual solution — stated as a principle, not a pitch].

[Soft CTA — a question to the audience, or "I've been writing about this more at alphasmb.com"]

#AI #[relevant hashtag] #[relevant hashtag]
```

**Example fill-in topics:**

- The real reason ChatGPT rollouts fail (it's not the tool)
- The real reason AI pilot programs never scale (it's not budget)
- The real reason your best employees aren't using AI (it's not laziness)

---

### Template 2 — "I Talked to [X] Leaders This Week. Here's What I Heard."

**Use for:** Sharing patterns from strategy calls (anonymized). Builds credibility through volume and real-world exposure.

**Frequency:** Weekly, once you have 3+ calls under your belt.

```
I talked to [number] [type of leader] this [week/month].

Every single one of them said some version of the same thing:

"[Direct quote or paraphrase of a common pain point you're hearing]."

Here's what's interesting about that.

[2-3 paragraphs unpacking why this pattern exists, what it reveals about the market, and what it means for SMBs trying to adopt AI. Connect it to organizational transformation, not technology.]

[1 paragraph with your take — the contrarian or surprising insight that most people aren't seeing.]

If you're hearing yourself in this, you're not alone. And you're not behind — you're just at the starting line.

[Soft CTA]

#AITransformation #Leadership #[relevant hashtag]
```

---

### Template 3 — "Unpopular Opinion: [Contrarian Take]"

**Use for:** Sparking debate, earning engagement, standing out from the AI hype cycle.

**Frequency:** Every 2-3 weeks. Don't overuse — contrarian loses its edge if every post is contrarian.

```
Unpopular opinion: [Bold, specific, contrarian statement about AI adoption].

[1-2 sentences acknowledging why the popular opinion exists. Show you understand the other side.]

But here's what that misses:

[3-4 short paragraphs building your case. Use a specific example or observation, not abstract reasoning. Each paragraph should be 1-2 sentences max.]

[1 closing paragraph that reframes the issue and lands on your actual position.]

I know this won't be popular. But I've seen it play out too many times to stay quiet about it.

What's your take?

#AI #[relevant hashtag] #[relevant hashtag]
```

**Example contrarian takes:**

- "Unpopular opinion: Most companies should stop buying AI tools immediately."
- "Unpopular opinion: Your AI strategy shouldn't start with AI."
- "Unpopular opinion: The best AI consultants should be trying to make themselves unnecessary."
- "Unpopular opinion: AI training for employees is mostly a waste of money."

---

### Template 4 — "The Difference Between [X] and [Y]"

**Use for:** Drawing sharp distinctions that clarify your positioning. Great for separating your approach from the market's default approach.

**Frequency:** Every 1-2 weeks. Pairs well with a visual carousel if you want to experiment with that format later.

```
There's a difference between [common approach] and [your approach].

[Common approach] looks like:
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]

[Your approach] looks like:
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]
- [Specific behavior or characteristic]

Most companies default to [common approach] because [reason — it's easier, it's what vendors sell them, it's what they've seen other companies do].

But [common approach] is why [negative outcome — adoption fails, tools sit unused, the initiative dies in 90 days].

[Your approach] works because [reason — tied to organizational transformation, culture change, or the methodology].

[Soft CTA or closing line that reinforces your positioning.]

#AI #AIStrategy #[relevant hashtag]
```

**Example pairings:**

- AI-equipped vs. AI-capable
- Tool rollout vs. transformation
- Training individuals vs. transforming organizations
- Buying AI vs. building AI capability
- Implementing AI vs. adopting AI

---

### Template 5 — "One Thing I'd Tell [Audience] About AI Right Now"

**Use for:** Delivering a single, concentrated insight. Short, punchy, high-signal. Good for weeks when you want to stay visible without a long post.

**Frequency:** Once a week as a filler between longer posts.

```
If I could tell every [SMB CEO / COO / founder / leadership team] one thing about AI right now, it would be this:

[Single sentence — the one thing. Make it specific and slightly unexpected.]

Here's why.

[3-4 short paragraphs explaining the insight. Ground it in something real — a pattern you've seen, a conversation you've had, a result you've observed.]

[1 closing paragraph. Short. Lands the point.]

That's it. One thing. But it changes how you think about everything else.

#AI #Leadership #[relevant hashtag]
```

**Example "one things":**

- "Your organization's AI readiness has almost nothing to do with technology."
- "The person who will drive your AI transformation is already on your team. You just haven't found them yet."
- "The AI tools your competitors use are the exact same ones available to you."
- "You don't need an AI strategy. You need an organizational change strategy that happens to involve AI."

## Posting Schedule (Ongoing After Launch Week)

| Day | Post Type | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Monday | Value / Insight post | Template 1, 4, or 5 — start the week with something useful |
| Wednesday | Story / Pattern post | Template 2 or 3 — mid-week engagement driver |
| Friday | Soft CTA / Credibility post | Recap a win, share a pattern, link to the site |

Three posts per week is sustainable and consistent. Increase to 4-5 only when you have the content energy to maintain quality.

---

## Notes

- **Engagement matters more than posting.** Spend 15-20 minutes per day commenting on other people's posts in your target audience's feed. Thoughtful comments from a credible profile drive more inbound than extra posts.
- **Repurpose strategy call insights.** Every anonymized pattern from calls is content. "I keep hearing X" posts are endlessly reusable.
- **Don't link in the post body.** Always put URLs in the first comment. LinkedIn's algorithm suppresses external links in the main post.
- **Tag sparingly.** Only tag people who will actually engage. Don't tag-spam for reach — it backfires.
- **Track what works.** Watch impressions, comments, and profile views. Double down on the formats that get real engagement, not just likes.
