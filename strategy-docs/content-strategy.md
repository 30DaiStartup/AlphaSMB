# AlphaSMB Content Strategy

*Last updated: 2026-02-19*

This document defines the content strategy for AlphaSMB. The primary channel is LinkedIn. The primary goal is driving strategy call bookings ($500, paid at booking). The audience is SMB leadership (CEOs, founders, COOs, VPs) at companies with 20-500 employees who know they need to move on AI but haven't figured out how to make it stick organizationally.

---

## 1. Content Pillars

Four pillars that AlphaSMB owns. Every post maps to one of these. They reinforce the core positioning: organizational transformation, not tool implementation.

### Pillar 1: AI adoption is an organizational problem, not a technology problem

The central thesis. AI tools are commodities — everyone has the same ones at the same price. The gap between companies winning with AI and companies fumbling is organizational capability: mindset, culture, process, and people. This pillar challenges the default assumption that AI adoption is about picking the right software.

**Why it works:** It reframes the conversation away from tool vendors and individual training (where SMB leaders have already spent money and been disappointed) toward the real issue they haven't addressed. It positions Zach as someone who sees the problem differently than every other AI voice on LinkedIn.

### Pillar 2: The champion model — transformation happens through people, not mandates

AI adoption doesn't spread through org charts. It spreads through influence. Every organization has a person (or a few people) that others already listen to. Find that person, activate them as the AI champion, and transformation cascades. Top-down mandates create compliance. Champions create culture.

**Why it works:** It's a specific, memorable framework. It gives leaders something actionable to think about immediately ("Who is our champion?"). It differentiates from consultants who sell org-wide rollouts or executive training programs.

### Pillar 3: The high-agency advantage — your best people are waiting for permission

Most organizations have employees who are already experimenting with AI on their own, quietly, without telling anyone. They're high-agency — proactive, self-directed, curious. They don't need training. They need permission, air cover, and a path to lead from within. Identifying and activating these people is the fastest way to build momentum.

**Why it works:** It resonates with leaders who suspect they have untapped internal talent. It's optimistic — you already have what you need, you just haven't surfaced it. It also creates recognition moments ("I know exactly who that person is on my team").

### Pillar 4: The window is closing — speed and compounding in AI adoption

The competitive gap from AI isn't linear, it's compounding. Organizations that build AI capability now pull further ahead every month. Organizations that wait don't just stay in the same place — they fall further behind relative to competitors who are learning, iterating, and building institutional AI knowledge. Trial and error is too slow when the window is shrinking.

**Why it works:** It creates urgency without being manipulative. It's genuinely true — organizational learning compounds. It moves leaders from "we'll get to it" to "we need to start now." It pairs naturally with the low-risk entry point ($500 strategy call as the obvious first step).

## 2. LinkedIn Posting Strategy

### Cadence

**3 posts per week.** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

- Tuesday: Story or observation (narrative-driven, builds connection)
- Wednesday: Framework or tactical insight (educational, builds authority)
- Thursday: Hot take or contrarian position (drives engagement, builds reach)

This cadence is sustainable for one person and avoids the weekend dead zone. If a post performs unusually well (2x+ normal engagement), consider a follow-up post the next day that goes deeper on the same topic.

### Content Types

**Stories (1x/week, Tuesday)**
First-person narratives from real experience. "Here's what happened when..." or "A CEO asked me last week..." These build trust and relatability. They show the work without selling the work.

- Length: 800-1,200 characters
- Structure: Hook (1-2 lines) > Setup > Tension/problem > Insight > One-line takeaway
- Always based on real situations (anonymized when from client work)
- End with a question or reflection, not a CTA

**Frameworks and tactical tips (1x/week, Wednesday)**
Teach something specific. Give away the thinking, not the doing. Share the methodology in pieces that are useful on their own but hint at a larger system. Lists, step-by-step breakdowns, "here's how I think about X."

- Length: 600-1,000 characters
- Structure: Bold claim or question > 3-5 steps/points > Brief explanation of each > So-what conclusion
- Use line breaks generously — LinkedIn readers scan, they don't read paragraphs
- Formats that work: numbered lists, "X things I've learned about Y," before/after comparisons

**Hot takes and contrarian positions (1x/week, Thursday)**
Challenge conventional wisdom about AI adoption. These drive comments, disagreements, and shares. They position Zach as someone with an actual point of view, not a consultant echoing the consensus.

- Length: 400-800 characters
- Structure: Provocative opening statement > Brief supporting argument > Reframe or implication
- Expect and welcome disagreement — reply to every comment
- Never be contrarian for its own sake; every take should be grounded in real experience

### Format Guidelines

**Voice:** First person, always. "I" not "we." Direct and conversational. Talk like you're explaining something to a smart friend who runs a business — not pitching, not lecturing, not performing.

**Opening lines matter most.** LinkedIn truncates after 2-3 lines. The first sentence must create enough curiosity to click "see more." Techniques:
- Start with a counterintuitive statement ("The worst thing you can do with AI is implement it.")
- Start with a specific number or observation ("80% of ChatGPT licenses at SMBs go unused within 30 days.")
- Start with a question that the reader has been thinking but hasn't articulated

**Formatting:**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Line breaks between every thought
- No hashtags in the body text (2-3 relevant hashtags at the very end, below the fold: #AIStrategy #SMB #AITransformation)
- No emojis in place of bullet points
- Bold or caps sparingly for emphasis — one key phrase per post at most

**What to avoid:**
- "Excited to announce" or "Thrilled to share"
- Jargon from the words-to-avoid list (leverage, synergy, unlock value, digital transformation journey, harness the power of AI, cutting-edge, disrupt, revolutionize, paradigm shift, best-in-class)
- Generic AI hype ("AI is changing everything!")
- Humble-bragging
- Posts that are obviously structured as a sales funnel ("I do X. If you need X, DM me.")
- Engagement bait ("Agree?", "Like if you think...", "Comment YES below")

**CTAs — use sparingly:**
- Most posts (2 out of 3) should have zero CTA. Just deliver value and end.
- When a post naturally connects to the strategy call offering, a soft CTA is fine: "If this sounds like your org, the strategy call is how I help leaders get unstuck: [link in comments]"
- Never put the link in the post body. Always "link in comments" or in the featured section of the profile.
- The profile does the selling. The posts build trust and authority. The profile converts.

## 3. Topic Clusters

Specific post ideas organized by pillar. Each can be adapted into multiple formats (story, framework, hot take).

### Pillar 1: Organizational problem, not a tech problem

1. **"You don't have an AI problem. You have an adoption problem."**
   Hot take. The tools work fine. The organization doesn't know how to absorb them. Stop shopping for better tools and start building the capability to use the ones you already have.

2. **"What happens 30 days after you buy ChatGPT Team licenses"**
   Story. Walk through the typical adoption curve: excitement in week 1, confusion in week 2, drop-off by week 4. 80% of users stop. Not because the tool is bad — because nobody changed how the organization works.

3. **"The three things that actually determine whether AI sticks at your company"**
   Framework. Mindset (does leadership believe this matters?), skillset (do people know what to do?), toolset (are the right tools accessible?). Most companies only address toolset.

4. **"AI tools are not a competitive advantage. AI culture is."**
   Hot take. Every company has access to the same AI tools at the same price point. The moat is organizational: how fast your team can learn, adapt, and integrate AI into actual workflows.

### Pillar 2: The champion model

5. **"The most important hire for AI transformation isn't an AI person"**
   Hot take. It's not a data scientist. It's not a CTO. It's the person your organization already listens to — the one with informal influence who people go to when they're stuck. Turn that person into your AI champion.

6. **"How to find your AI champion in 15 minutes"**
   Framework. Ask three questions: (1) Who do people go to when they need help figuring something out? (2) Who's already quietly using AI tools on their own? (3) Who gets excited about new ways of doing things instead of resistant? If one name comes up for all three, that's your champion.

7. **"Why top-down AI mandates backfire"**
   Story. Contrast two approaches: the CEO who sent a company-wide email mandating Copilot usage (compliance, resentment, surface-level adoption) vs. the CEO who found one champion in operations and let it spread organically (curiosity, pull-based adoption, actual behavior change).

### Pillar 3: The high-agency advantage

8. **"Your team is already using AI. They're just not telling you."**
   Story. In almost every organization I assess, there are 2-5 people who are actively using AI tools on their own — sometimes against policy. They're not waiting for permission. They're solving real problems. Your job isn't to train them. It's to find them and give them air cover.

9. **"The difference between high-agency and low-agency AI adoption"**
   Framework. High-agency: experiments on their own, finds use cases, teaches others, iterates. Low-agency: waits for training, follows scripts, uses AI once and stops, asks "what am I supposed to do with this?" You can't turn low-agency into high-agency with a workshop. You can find your high-agency people and build around them.

10. **"Stop training everyone. Start activating the right people."**
    Hot take. The default move is company-wide AI training. It's expensive, generic, and forgettable. Instead: identify your high-agency people, give them resources and permission, let them build use cases specific to your business, then scale what works through peer influence.

### Pillar 4: The window is closing

11. **"AI adoption compounds. So does the cost of waiting."**
    Framework. Month 1: your competitor starts building AI capability. Month 3: they've found 2-3 workflows that save 10+ hours/week. Month 6: those workflows are embedded in how they operate. Month 12: they've built institutional AI knowledge you can't replicate by just buying the same tools. The gap isn't the tools. It's the 12 months of learning they have that you don't.

12. **"The $500 question every SMB leader should be asking right now"**
    Story. Frame the strategy call as the specific, low-risk first step. "I talk to SMB leaders every week who've been 'thinking about AI' for 6-12 months. Thinking isn't a strategy. A strategy is what you have after one focused hour with someone who's done this at the Fortune 1000 level."

13. **"You don't need a $50K consulting engagement to start"**
    Hot take. The big consulting firms have convinced everyone that AI transformation requires a six-figure engagement and a six-month timeline. It doesn't. You need clarity on where you stand, a plan for where to go, and a first step you can take this week. That's an hour of focused work, not a quarter of handholding.

### Bonus: Cross-pillar / brand-building

14. **"I run AI strategy for a Fortune 1000 company. Here's why I started working with SMBs."**
    Story. Origin post. The methodology works. It shouldn't be locked behind enterprise budgets. SMBs can actually move faster because they have less bureaucracy. This is the work I find most meaningful — helping capable businesses stop getting left behind.

15. **"What 'anti-consultant' actually means"**
    Hot take / manifesto. I don't do slide decks. I don't do 90-day discovery phases. I don't sell you a retainer so I can bill hours. I give you a plan you can execute without me. If you need more help, I'll tell you. If you don't, I'll tell you that too.

## 4. Content-to-Conversion Flow

The path from LinkedIn post to booked strategy call. No single post should try to do all the work. The system works as a whole.

### The funnel

```
LinkedIn post (builds trust, demonstrates expertise)
    |
    v
Profile visit (visitor reads headline, about section, featured section)
    |
    v
Website click (alphasmb.com — lands on home page or strategy call page)
    |
    v
Strategy call page (reads deliverables, time blocks, FAQ, social proof)
    |
    v
Book page (Cal.com embed, $500 Stripe payment)
```

### How each piece works

**Posts** are the top of funnel. Their job is to make the reader think: "This person understands my problem better than I do." Posts do not sell. They build authority, create recognition ("that's exactly what's happening at my company"), and make the reader want to know more about who wrote this.

**The LinkedIn profile** is the conversion bridge. It must clearly communicate:
- What Zach does (headline: something like "Fractional Head of AI | I help SMB leaders build AI-capable organizations")
- Why he's credible (Aurora WDC, Fortune 1000, 20+ years)
- What the next step is (Featured section: link to alphasmb.com/services/strategy-call with a brief description)
- The profile "About" section should read like a condensed version of the AlphaSMB about page — first person, direct, credential-dense but not braggy

**The website** closes the deal. The home page validates everything the LinkedIn content has been saying. The strategy call page answers the remaining questions (what do I get? is this for me? what does it cost?). The book page removes friction (Cal.com embed, immediate scheduling).

### Key principles

- **Never sell in posts.** The post's job is to be so insightful that the reader clicks on your name. The profile's job is to make them click the website link. The website's job is to make them book.
- **"Link in comments" over "link in post."** LinkedIn suppresses posts with outbound links. When linking is necessary, put the URL in the first comment and reference it: "Link to the strategy call page in the comments."
- **Featured section is prime real estate.** Pin one item: a link to the strategy call page with a brief, compelling description. This is the most common path from profile to website.
- **Soft CTAs only, and only when natural.** 1 in 3 posts can include a soft mention: "This is the kind of thing I help leaders figure out in the strategy call." The other 2 posts should have zero mention of services.
- **Comments are content.** Reply to every comment on your posts. Reply thoughtfully to other people's posts about AI, SMBs, or organizational change. These replies are visible to the commenter's network and drive profile visits.

## 5. Content Repurposing: The Strategy Call Feedback Loop

Every strategy call generates insights that feed back into content. This creates a flywheel: content drives calls, calls generate content, better content drives more calls.

### What to capture from each call (anonymized)

After every strategy call, spend 5 minutes noting:

1. **The question they asked that surprised me** — What did they want to know that I didn't expect? This reveals gaps in how leaders are thinking about AI.
2. **The moment they said "that's exactly our problem"** — What framing or insight landed hardest? This is proven messaging to reuse.
3. **The pattern** — Does this client's situation match a pattern I've seen before? If I've heard the same problem three times, it's a post.
4. **The objection or hesitation** — What almost stopped them from booking, or what concern came up during the call? This is FAQ content and objection-handling material.
5. **The industry-specific detail** — What made this company's AI challenges unique to their industry? Industry-specific posts perform well because they feel personal to readers in that industry.

### How to turn call insights into posts

| Call insight | Post format | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| A question you hear repeatedly | Hot take answering it | "Every CEO asks me the same question about AI. Here's what I tell them." |
| A pattern across multiple clients | Framework post | "3 signs your AI adoption is stuck at the tool level" |
| A surprising outcome or realization | Story post | "A COO told me last week that their biggest AI problem wasn't what I expected." |
| An industry-specific challenge | Targeted story | "Healthcare SMBs have a unique AI adoption problem that nobody talks about." |
| A before/after transformation | Case study (anonymized) | "6 weeks after our strategy call, here's what changed." (with client permission) |

### Rules for anonymization

- Never name the company, the person, or details specific enough to identify them
- Change the industry if the insight is universal (e.g., "a professional services firm" instead of "a law firm in Dallas")
- If the insight is industry-specific and you want to keep the industry, change the company size, geography, or other identifying details
- When in doubt, ask the client: "I'd love to share this insight (anonymized) on LinkedIn. Are you comfortable with that?"
- Once you have testimonials and explicit permission, use real names and quotes — these convert far better than anonymized stories

## 6. Metrics

What to track, where to find it, and what good looks like.

### Primary metrics (weekly review)

| Metric | Where to find it | Target (first 90 days) | Why it matters |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Strategy calls booked | Cal.com dashboard | 2-3/week by month 3 | Revenue. The number that matters most. |
| Website visits from LinkedIn | Plausible (filter by UTM or referrer) | 50+/week by month 3 | Measures whether content is driving site traffic |
| LinkedIn profile views | LinkedIn analytics | 200+/week by month 3 | Leading indicator — people are clicking through from posts |

### Secondary metrics (monthly review)

| Metric | Where to find it | Target (first 90 days) | Why it matters |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| LinkedIn post impressions (avg) | LinkedIn analytics | 1,000+ avg per post by month 3 | Measures reach. Are posts getting distributed? |
| LinkedIn engagement rate | LinkedIn analytics | 2-3% (engagements/impressions) | Measures resonance. Are posts landing? |
| Strategy call page views | Plausible (/services/strategy-call) | 30+/week by month 3 | Measures intent — people who are seriously considering |
| Book page views | Plausible (/book) | 15+/week by month 3 | Measures high intent — people ready to commit |
| Booking conversion rate | Book page views vs. bookings | 20%+ | Measures whether the book page is doing its job |
| LinkedIn follower growth | LinkedIn analytics | 100+ net new/month | Measures growing audience, but not a goal in itself |

### What to do with the numbers

**Weekly (5 minutes):** Check bookings, site visits, and profile views. Are they trending up? If bookings drop while site traffic holds steady, the website needs work. If site traffic drops while impressions hold, the profile needs work. If impressions drop, the content needs work.

**Monthly (30 minutes):** Review which posts performed best and worst. Look for patterns:
- Which pillar resonated most?
- Which content type (story, framework, hot take) drove the most profile views?
- Which topics generated the most comments?
- Did any post drive a noticeable spike in site traffic or bookings?

Double down on what's working. Drop what isn't. Adjust the topic mix based on data, not instinct.

**Quarterly (1 hour):** Step back and assess:
- Is LinkedIn the right primary channel? (It should be for this audience, but verify.)
- Is the content-to-booking conversion path working, or is there a leak?
- Are the content pillars still the right ones, or has the market conversation shifted?
- What new patterns from strategy calls should become new content themes?

### Metrics to ignore

- **Likes** as a standalone number. Likes are cheap engagement. Comments and profile views matter more.
- **Follower count** as a goal. A small, highly engaged audience of SMB leaders is worth more than a large, passive audience of AI enthusiasts.
- **Post frequency beyond 3x/week.** More posts doesn't mean more bookings. Consistency and quality matter more than volume. If you skip a week, that's fine. If you post 5 times in a week but they're rushed, that's worse than 2 great posts.

## Appendix: LinkedIn Profile Optimization Checklist

The profile is the conversion bridge between posts and the website. Optimize it before starting the content cadence.

- **Headline:** Lead with the value, not the title. Example: "I help SMB leaders build AI-capable organizations | Fractional Head of AI at Aurora WDC"
- **About section:** First person. 3-4 short paragraphs. What you do, who it's for, why you're credible, what the next step is. End with a CTA to the strategy call page.
- **Featured section:** One item — link to alphasmb.com/services/strategy-call with the headline "One-Hour AI Strategy Call — $500" and a 1-sentence description.
- **Experience:** Aurora WDC (current) should be first and clearly describe the AI strategy work. AlphaSMB should be listed with a description that mirrors the site's positioning.
- **Banner image:** Use the AlphaSMB brand (charcoal + ember palette). Keep it simple — the wordmark or a one-line value prop.
- **Profile photo:** Professional but approachable. The headshot from the about page works.
- **Creator mode:** Turn it on. It surfaces the "Featured" section and adds a "Follow" button (vs. "Connect"), which is better for content distribution.
